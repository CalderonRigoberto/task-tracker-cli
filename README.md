# Task Tracker CLI

A command-line task tracking application built as part of my Java learning journey following the [roadmap.sh]([https://roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)) path. This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern Java features while helping others learn through real-world examples.

## About This Project

This Task Tracker is a practical exercise in building command-line applications using Java, focusing on modern language features and clean code practices. It's part of a series of projects aimed at improving Java skills through hands-on experience.

## Key Technologies & Concepts Used

- **Modern Java Features**
    - Records for immutable data structures
    - Stream API for data processing
    - Local variable type inference (var)
    - Pattern Matching (Java 17+)

- **Libraries**
    - Jackson for JSON file handling
        - JSON reading/writing
        - Object mapping
        - Data persistence

- **Project Purpose**
    - Practice modern Java features
    - Learn file handling and data persistence
    - Implement CLI interfaces
    - Apply clean code principles

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:
- Building interactive CLI applications
- Working with file systems using Java
- Data persistence using JSON
- Modern Java features in a real-world context
